## Causal inference

Causal inference attempts to estimate the [causal effect]{.highlight1} of an [intervention]{.highlight1} on a particular [outcome.]{.highlight1} Causal inference involves the [careful design and analysis]{.highlight1} of experiments and observational studies.

## Fundamental problem

<br><br>

:::{.center-big}
The fundamental problem of causal inference is that we only only observe one potential outcome.
<br><br><br>
Causal inference is a **missing data problem.**
:::


## Moving to many units

- How do we solve the fundamental problem of causal inference?
- Instead of thinking about individual-level treatment effects, focus on the **average** treatment effect (ATE).

\begin{align*}
\tau &= \bar{Y}(1) - \bar{Y}(0) \\
&= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[ Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)\right]\\
\end{align*}

## Categories of causal studies

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
**Randomised experiments**

  - Treatment assignment is [controlled]{.highlight1} by the researcher.
  - Clinical trials, education experiments, psychology, industrial experiments, agriculture, A/B testing in tech.
  - Treatment groups tend to have [similar covariates]{.highlight1}. (We sometimes call this [balance]{.highlight1}.)
  - Causal inference is straightforward.
  - We still want to take care in design and analysis to get best possible answers.

**Observational studies**

  - Treatment assignment is [not controlled]{.highlight1} by the researcher.
  - Epidemiology, criminology, political science, economics.
  - Treatment groups [usually do not have similar covariates]{.highlight1}.
  - Causal inference is difficult (sometimes impossible).
  - Careful design & analysis is required.

## Factorial experiments in environmental studies

- [Factorial]{.highlight1}: I want to evaluate more than one factor and their interaction.
  - What is the effect of different weed management strategies on ecosystem function? [@Iddris2023]. $2^2$ field experiment: high v. low fertilization, mechanical v. herbicide weeding
- [Fractional factorial]{.highlight1}: I want to run a factorial experiment with many factors, but I don't have enough units for every possible combination.
  - Toxicity evaluation of 10 different microplastics to aquatic organisms [@Enyoh2022].

<!-- - What is the support level in the Global North for stricter global supply chain sustainability standards? [@Kolcava2023] -->
<!--   - Survey experiment to test 36 combinations of 3 different factors: scope, transparency, and enforcement. -->

## Blocked experiments in environmental studies

- [Latin square]{.highlight1}: I want to reduce my variance/increase power by blocking on two potential sources of unwanted variation.
  - Evaluate the effectiveness of a bycatch reduction devices by blocking on net and tow [@Burridge2000].
- [Split-plot design]{.highlight1}: My units fall into batches and I want to avoid "bad" randomisations.
  - Evaluate the effect of tillage on phosphorus leaching. For each parcel of land, randomly assign half of parcel to tillage and half to no tillage [@Butler2005].


## Observational studies

- [Confounding]{.highlight1}: In observational data, background characteristics can influence both (1) which treatment a unit receives, and (2) its potential outcomes.
- The consequence is that effect estimates are [biased]{.highlight1} unless careful design and analysis is used.

## Matching

The goal of designing an observational study is to [approximate a randomised experiment]{.highlight1} as closely as possible, and mitigate the effects of confounding. One approach is **matching**.

![](figures/matching.png){fig-align="center"}

## Matching

Statistical interpretation:

- If we produce high quality matches, we can consider ourselves to [approximate a randomised experiment]{.highlight1}.
- We can consider it a coin flip which unit happened to receive active treatment v. control treatment.
- We have controlled for all [observed confounding variables]{.highlight1}.

## Case study: evaluating carbon offsets

**Question:** What is the impact of human-induced regeneration (HIR) carbon offset projects on forest cover? [@Macintosh2024]

- HIR projects: regeneration of even-aged native forests through changes in land management on land that previously contained forest cover.
- 5th largest nature-based solution offset in the world by carbon credit issuances.

<!-- ## Matching -->

<!-- - **Matching goal**: for each pixel in a HIR project area, match it to a control unit not part of any HIR projects. -->
<!-- - **Procedure**: match based on soil, rainfall, biome, distance to project pixel, etc. -->
<!-- - **Result**: A good set of matches [isolates]{.highlight1} the causal effect of the HIR land management. -->

## Initial results for HIR projects

## Some select challenges in causal inference

- Incorporating time series and spatial information into causal methods
- Matching based on high-dimensional data
- Continuous treatments
- Time-varying treatments
- Complex outcome response surfaces
- Interference between units
